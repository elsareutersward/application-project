# Application Project

This project was made for the application to the Technigo Frontend Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a simple page explaining a tech related word using ones current knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

## The problem

For the project I focused on using different elements of HTML, for exaple creating headings, paragraphs, a list and links. For the CSS I focused mainly on creating a good layout using margins and paddings, and adding a color scheme to make the page look nicer. I also practised on using google fonts.
